        <h2 id="manuscript"><strong>Manuscript Evaluation</strong></h2>
        <p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve just completed your first draft.
          Now you need someone to read through and isolate any areas that need
          more unpacking and further development.</p>

          <p>Are you having trouble figuring out what you want to say? I can
          ask you the right questions to get at the heart of your story.​ ​Or
          perhaps you have written several drafts and now you just need an
          honest, unbiased perspective.</p>

          <p>Book this service if you have not been through any revisions nor
          have you had any professional readers. ​​A manuscript evaluation includes an editorial
          letter that covers all of the broad-scope issues in your manuscript.</p>

        <h2 id="developmental"><strong>Developmental Editing</strong></h2>
        <p>This service is a little more involved than a manuscript evaluation.
          In addition to focusing on the broader editorial issues, I will also
          provide narrower-in-scope, specific comments within the text.</p>

          <p>Do you feel like something is missing in your story, but you&#8217;re not quite sure
          what exactly? I can work with you to figure it out. I will read through
          your manuscript and focus on content, structure, and style. Does your
          overall story work? Is the narrative arc satisfying? Is the internal
          structure of each chapter consistent throughout the manuscript? Is a
          character coming across as too caricatured? Does your protagonist need
          more motivation? Does some of the dialogue feel forced? I will offer
          suggestions, comments, and edits, but I&#8217;ll be careful to maintain your
          authorial voice.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-12 service-blurb">
        <h2 id="line"><strong>Line Editing</strong></h2>
        <p>After you have nailed down your foundation and the broader aspects of
          your manuscript, you will be ready for more in-depth editing​. ​​​I will
          go through sentence by sentence and offer suggestions/edits on flow,
          structure, voice, and other micro-level concerns.​</p><p>​This service is
          essentially editing that does not focus on the broader editorial
          concerns that are covered in the developmental editing service.</p>

        <h2 id="query"><strong>Query Letter Review</strong></h2>
        <p>​Your manuscript has been through countless laborious revisions and
          now you are finally ready to pitch to your favorite agent. As a former
          acquisitions editor at a major publisher, I have reviewed many pitches
          from both agents and authors, and I have a strong sense of what works
          and what doesn&#8217;t work in a query letter.</p><p>I can help you hone and
          sharpen your pitch to make it as compelling as your story. I can offer
          you guidance on creating a query letter that not only sells your story,
          but more importantly, piques the agent&#8217;s interest. A well-written query
          can elevate your submission above the others in the slush pile, and I
          can help you take it there.</p>

        <h2 id="synopsis"><strong>Synopsis Editing</strong></h2>
        <p>​​​​An essential component to your initial pitch, a synopsis can make or
          break your query. ​This service is usually booked together with query
          letter editing. ​I&#8217;ll go through sentence by sentence and ensure that
          each word you use should be there.​ I will advise on how you can shorten,
          lengthen, and/or refine your synopsis.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-12 service-blurb">
        <h2 id="copy"><strong>Copy Editing</strong></h2>
        <p>​​​​If your manuscript ​has been through several revisions and you have
          resolved all creative content issues, this service is for you. Unlike
          developmental editing or line editing, copy editing focuses on
          grammar, spelling, punctuation, and syntax. I will also ensure that
          you are maintaining internal consistency with your dialogue,
          characters, setting, etc.</p><p>Your manuscript should be in its final
          form before you consider a copy editing service.</p>
