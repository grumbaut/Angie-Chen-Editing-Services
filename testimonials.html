      <p>&#8220;There are no words that can accurately depict the bounds of my gratitude.
        In addition to Angie&#8217;s enthusiasm for my writing, her support,
        insight, and editorial talents truly helped shape <em>Finding Perfect</em>.
        She saw gaps in the early draft and helped me construct ways to fill
        them. She was both teacher and collaborator. Always available to
        brainstorm a storyline or help unravel the nuances of a
        character. She was exceptional at her craft and at helping me hone mine.
        Working with Angie was a gift. One that I will always cherish.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Angie is amazing at coaxing a story&#8217;s plot and characters and theme to
         bloom at just the right moments and is able to approach a manuscript
         with that keen editorial eye. But she also knows how to balance her
         editorial expertise with respect for the author, and the result is
         absolute brilliance. I highly recommend Angie as an editor and as an
         advocate for your manuscript!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ms. Chen was in high demand, but the slightly greater time I
        had to wait for her help was well worth it; her recommendations are meticulous, intelligent, and
        go far beyond what I could see myself as someone very close to the text, or what the kind
        laypeople who had generously reviewed my manuscript had seen up to then. Angie has a talent
        for understanding the work on many levels. She had brilliant, big picture ideas for the work as a
        whole, recommendations for specific sections, and innumerable suggestions for changes at the
        individual paragraph and sentence level.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;It was a pleasure working with Angie. Her feedback was original and insightful. I had the sense
that she genuinely cared about my novel and wanted to make it the best that it could be. Her
edits helped take my writing to the next level.&#8221;</p>
